**Note: You may need to turn on experimental feature flag in your Chrome browser to access these native AI APIs.**
**\_Task - AI-Powered Text Processing Interface
Using HTML, CSS and Js/Ts, React or any React Framework(eg. Next etc), develop build and host an AI-Powered Text Processing Interface using Chrome's AI APIs. This application will allow users to input text and utilize features such as summarization, translation, and language detection. Users should be able to interact with a clean, responsive UI that ensures accessibility and provides meaningful feedback for errors.
Requirements**\_

**Summary:**
The UI should look like a chat interface with a textarea field in the bottom of the page and the output field should be the the area above.
When a user inputs a text and send, The text should Immediately render in the output area just like a normal chat window.
Use the Language detector API to detect the text language and render it below the output text.
Right below the text,

- Summarize: If the text is more than 150 characters, render a button below the text that reads "Summarize". Make use of the Summarizer API to achieve this.
- Translate: Render a simple select option field to switch between the languages listed below and a button that reads "Translate" to translate the output text to the selected language. Use the Translator API.
  -English(en)
  -Portuguese (pt)
  -Spanish (es)
  -Russian (ru)
  -Turkish (tr)
  -French (fr)

**Render the translated or(and) summarized output below the initial output text.**

**NOTE: For summary, render the Summarize button only for output texts that are in English language.**

**Core Features**

- Input Display: Render a large, user-friendly textarea field for users to type or paste text and a send button that displays only a send icon.
- Language Selector: Allow users to choose between languages listed above.
- Action Buttons: Render two(2) action buttons(Summarize and Translate) to process the output text.
- Output Display: Display the processed result (summary, translation, or detected language) in a styled output area.
- API Integration: Use the selected Chrome AI API to process the input text asynchronously. Handle API responses and errors gracefully, ensuring users receive helpful feedback in case of issues.
- Accessibility: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and accessible with screen readers. Provide meaningful ARIA labels and focus indicators for input fields and buttons.
- Responsive Design: Optimize the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Use a flexible grid or stacked layout to enhance the user experience on smaller screens.

**Acceptance Criteria**

**_Functionality:_**

- Users can input text, send text and it renders in the output field.
- Users should be able to summarize text outputs if the output text is more than 150 characters.
- Users should be able to translate output texts to the different languages listed.
- The app should successfully communicate with the Chrome AI APIs to retrieve accurate results.
- Display processed results in the output area after API calls are complete.

**_Error Handling:_**

- Show an error message if:
- The API call fails.
- The input text is empty or invalid.
- Error messages should be clear.

**_Responsive Design:_**

- The interface must adjust appropriately to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

**_Code Quality:_**

- Use modular, readable code with proper comments and structure.
- Implement async/await or Promises for API calls and error handling.
